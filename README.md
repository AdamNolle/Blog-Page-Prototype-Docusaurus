# Blog site built using Docusaurus

# NOTE:

_This was more or less an exploration of Docusaurus_

## Information:

This is a prototype of a blog site using docusaurus. I only spent about an afternoon with it before switching to a simpler solution for current production but an interesting project nonetheless. 

## Issues and Notes:

- Linking it to my current personal website
- Need to deploy and build locally on Digital Ocean server (to many small files to transfer over Filezilla from my desktop to server)
